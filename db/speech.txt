I speak not of a small reform, but of a revolution in thought. 
The chains that bind us are not made of iron, but of ideas. They are the ideas that tell 
one man he is pure and another that he is polluted. They are the ideas that sanctify 
inequality and call it duty. So long as these ideas remain, liberty will be a hollow word.

Caste is not a division of labor; it is a division of laborers. It assigns worth not by 
ability but by birth. It cripples cooperation, poisons fraternity, and denies equality. 
No nation can progress when millions are condemned to silence and servitude. The measure 
of civilization is not in temples or rituals, but in how it treats its weakest members.

The scriptures that sanctify caste are not eternal truths. They are human documents, 
written in a time when inequality was considered natural. But no injustice can be eternal. 
No cruelty can be sacred. If we are to build a society of equals, we must first destroy 
the belief that these texts are infallible. Reform that does not strike at the root of 
caste is no reform at all. The real enemy is the belief in the sanctity of the shastras.

Consider the gardener who trims the leaves of a poisonous tree. The tree grows again, 
stronger than before. But if he strikes at the root, the poison dies. So too must we strike 
at the root of caste. Cutting branches will not kill the tree; only uprooting it will.

True progress demands courage. It demands that we question tradition, even when tradition 
is wrapped in the cloak of religion. To follow blindly is to surrender reason. To resist 
caste is to affirm humanity. The real enemy is not the individual who discriminates, but 
the system that teaches discrimination as duty.

Let us remember: liberty without equality is hollow, and equality without fraternity is 
fragile. The three must stand together, or democracy will collapse. The task before us is 
not small. It is to remake society on the foundation of justice, to ensure that no man is 
denied his rights because of birth.

The annihilation of caste is not a dream; it is a necessity. Without it, India cannot be 
free. Without it, democracy cannot be real. Without it, the people cannot be united. 
Therefore, let us pledge to fight not against men, but against the ideas that enslave men. 
Let us pledge to build a society where dignity is not a privilege, but a birthright.

And let us not forget: the struggle will be long. There will be resistance from those who 
profit from inequality. There will be voices that call reform sacrilege. But truth is 
stronger than tradition, and justice is stronger than scripture. If we stand firm, the 
edifice of caste will crumble.
 the future is ours to shape. We can choose silence, and remain 
chained. Or we can choose courage, and break the chains forever. The choice is clear. 
The time is now. Rise, and claim your dignity. Rise, and claim your humanity. Rise, and 
build a new society where caste is no more.

Democracy is not merely a system of government; it is a way of life. It rests upon the 
principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity. If any one of these pillars is weakened, 
democracy will collapse. Liberty without equality breeds privilege. Equality without 
fraternity breeds conflict. Fraternity without liberty breeds stagnation. The three must 
stand together, or democracy will perish.

Caste is the greatest enemy of democracy. It denies equality, poisons fraternity, and 
renders liberty meaningless. A society divided into rigid hierarchies cannot be democratic. 
It cannot be free. It cannot be just. Therefore, the annihilation of caste is not merely a 
social reform; it is the foundation of democracy itself.

We must not be content with pruning the branches of caste. We must strike at its roots. 
We must destroy the belief that inequality is divinely ordained. We must reject the 
authority of scriptures that sanctify injustice. We must affirm the dignity of every human 
being, regardless of birth.

The task before us is immense. It requires courage, sacrifice, and perseverance. But it is 
a task that must be undertaken. For without it, India cannot be free. Without it, democracy 
cannot be real. Without it, the people cannot be united.

Let us pledge to fight not against men, but against the ideas that enslave men. Let us 
pledge to build a society where dignity is not a privilege, but a birthright. Let us pledge 
to annihilate caste, and to build a new India on the foundation of liberty, equality, and 
fraternity.
